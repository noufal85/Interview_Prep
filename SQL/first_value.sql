/*
The SQL snippet you've provided is using a window function, specifically `FIRST_VALUE`, to return the first value in an ordered set of values from the `PRODUCT_TYPE` column. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

- `FIRST_VALUE(SAA.PRODUCT_TYPE)`: This function gets the first value of `PRODUCT_TYPE` from the `SAA` alias table based on the specified order in the `OVER` clause.

- `OVER (PARTITION BY SAA.PARENT_ASIN ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT SAA.ASIN) DESC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)`: This defines the window over which the `FIRST_VALUE` function operates.
  - `PARTITION BY SAA.PARENT_ASIN`: This partitions the data into groups, with each group having the same `PARENT_ASIN`. The `FIRST_VALUE` function is applied to each partition separately.
  - `ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT SAA.ASIN) DESC`: This orders the rows in each partition by the count of distinct `ASIN` values in descending order.
  - `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`: This specifies the range of rows in the partition to consider for the `FIRST_VALUE` function, which in this case is all rows in the partition.

- `AS PRODUCT_TYPE`: This aliases the result of the `FIRST_VALUE` function as `PRODUCT_TYPE`.

In essence, this function will return the `PRODUCT_TYPE` of the first row in each partition ordered by the descending count of distinct `ASIN` values. This value will be the same for all rows in each partition because the window frame is set to the entire partition.
